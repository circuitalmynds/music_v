I made this video to promote a great track by Patrick Cowley. This track is based on the theme song of the television series Sea Hunt (1958 - 1961). Patrick Joseph Cowley (October 19, 1950 – November 12, 1982) was an American disco and Hi-NRG dance music composer and recording artist. Besides Giorgio Moroder, he often is credited as a pioneer of electronic dance music.
